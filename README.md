## 🙌 About This Project

Managing finances as a student or early professional can be overwhelming. This dashboard was inspired by my own real-life experience of living independently and learning how to make every dollar count.

From biweekly part-time income to ride-sharing costs, grocery runs, church rides, and even a $700 hospital visit — every piece of this dashboard reflects real-world scenarios. I created this not just as a portfolio item, but as a meaningful, problem-solving tool that helped me understand where my money goes — and how I can save more.

The goal? Turn raw, messy data into something powerful, clear, and empowering — and prove that data analytics can make everyday life better.

## 📌 Final Thoughts
